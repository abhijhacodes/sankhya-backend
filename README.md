## Sankhya

Sankhya is a B2B user analytics tool that gives you analytics about your users such as:

-   Total page visits
-   Page visits daywise trend
-   User distribution by geographic details such as city, state, country and continent
-   Hourwise traffic trend, etc.

<br/>

**All of these analytics details are zero config and are available to you out of the box with a single API integration**

<br/>

#### Tech stack:

-   Express JS backend framework
-   Typescript
-   PostgreSQL as database (No ORM, raw SQL queries for better performance)
-   [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/) to interact with DB
-   Redis queue (To be added)

<br/>
