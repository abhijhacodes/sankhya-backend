## Sankhya

Sankhya is a privacy friendly and cookie-free user analytics tool that gives you analytics about your users such as:

-   Total page visits
-   Page visits daywise trend
-   User distribution by geographic details such as city, state, country and continent
-   Hourwise traffic trend, etc.

<br/>

**All of these analytics details are zero config and are available to you out of the box with a single API integration**
